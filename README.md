Data-Representation
===================

Representing data as a tree using LAMP(Linux-Apache-MySql-PHP)

This little effort will show you how to first install PHP, Apache and MySql using Ubuntu.

To install PHP on the system. First open the terminal and type 

$ sudo apt-get install php5

$ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

To install Apache, Apache is the server required to run PHP source files.

$ sudo apt-get install apache2

To install MYSQL 

$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server

During installation, you will be asked to enter password for MySql root user.

After all the installations are done, next step is to configure them and start developing an application. 
Any Text Editor can be used to write PHP code. Ubuntu has gedit in-built text editor.
