The task here is to represent data in hierarchical manner in database. The database here used is MySql. The method 
followed to represent the data is Nested Set Model. In this method, nodes are read from left to right and they are given
number from left to right. Parent node being at the top, is given 1 and all other gets in an order from left to right.
This approach is known as modified preorder tree traversal algorithm.

A table "category" is created in MySql having attributes as category_id int auto_increment, name varchar(20). lft int and 
rgt int. We cannot use left and right as attributes because both are the keywords in MySql.
